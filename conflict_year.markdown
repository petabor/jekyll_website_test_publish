  <div data-year="1989">
  <p><strong>Armed conflicts and related deaths in 1989 were heavily concentrated in Africa with highest death toll in <strong><a href="https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/ethiopia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethiopia</a></strong> (~25,000), largely due to civil war, famine, and conflict with separatist groups.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    The civil war between the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Derg</a></strong> regime and rebel groups reached catastrophic levels exacerbated by famine. Derg regime was apart from other brutalities responsible for the death of <strong><a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haile_Selassie" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Haile Selassie</a></strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    High numbers in Sudan were result of <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Sudanese_Civil_War" target="_blank" rel="noopener">civil war</a></strong> between the government and the Sudan People’s Liberation Army (SPLA). 
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_withdrawal_from_Afghanistan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Withdrawal</a></strong> of soviet army from Afghanistan was followed by intesified fighting between the communist government and mujahideen resistance groups and marked the onset of <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_Civil_War_(1989%E2%80%931992)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">First Afghan Civil War</a></strong>. 
  </p>
  </div>
  <div data-year="1990">
  <p>
  <strong>The conflicts of 1990 were highly concentrated in Africa and South Asia, with new hotspots emerging in the Middle East (due to the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_War" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gulf crisis</a></strong>).</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    The <strong>Ethiopian Civil War</strong> intensified and the number of causalities doubled the toll of the previous year with almost 50,000 deaths. In <strong>Sudan</strong> the civil war continued with massive civilian causalities, and the conflict in <strong>Sri Lanka</strong> between the goverment and <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_War" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tamil Tigers</a></strong> escalated.  
  </p>
  <p>
    In <strong>Rwanda</strong>, the tensions escalated with the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) launching incursions from Uganda, marking the beginning of years of violent conflict.
  </p>
  </div>
  <div data-year="1991">
  <p>
  <strong>By 1991, conflict-related deaths spanned much of Africa, the Middle East, South Asia, and Central America, with new violence in Eastern Europe.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    In January 1991, the U.S.-led coalition launched <strong><a href="https://www.war.gov/News/Feature-Stories/story/Article/1728715/desert-storm-a-look-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Operation Desert Storm</a></strong> to expel <strong>Iraqi</strong> forces from Kuwait. While Iraqi military deaths were very high, civilian casualties from bombings, massacres (e.g., uprisings in Basra and Kurdistan), and displacement brought the toll to over 20,000. The war reshaped regional dynamics, leaving Iraq weakened but still under Saddam Hussein.
  </p>
  <p>
    Civil wars in <strong>Ethiopia</strong>, <strong>Somalia</strong>, and <strong>Sudan</strong> continued. In Ethiopia conflict resulted in Mengistu’s Derg regime collapse with <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eritrean_War_of_Independence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eritrea</a></strong> moving toward independence, whereas Somalia plunged into full-scale anarchy.
  </p>
  <p>
    In Eastern Europe, the breakup of <strong>Yugoslavia</strong> began, with fighting erupting in Croatia and Serbia in 1991, marking the start of the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yugoslav_Wars" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yugoslav Wars</a></strong>.
  </p>
  </div>
  <div data-year="1992">
  <p>
  <strong>By 1992, violent conflicts spanned Europe, Africa, Asia, and Latin America, reflecting the post–Cold War upheavals.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    In <strong>Bosnia-Herzegovina</strong>, the war broke out after independence from Yugoslavia. <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_cleansing_in_the_Bosnian_War" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethnic cleansing</a></strong> campaigns by Serb forces led to massive civilian deaths, quickly becoming one of the bloodiest conflicts in Europe since WWII.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Somalia, Sudan, Sri Lanka</strong>, and <strong>Afghanistan</strong> remained deadly war zones largely due to ongoing civil wars resulting in famine. 
  </p>
  <p>
    New conflict broke out in former Soviet Union countries - <strong>Tajikistan</strong> and <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh_conflict" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nagorno-Karabakh</a></strong>, marked the onset of long-lasting conflict between <strong>Armenia</strong> and <strong>Azerbaijan</strong>.
  </p>
  </div>
  <div data-year="1993">
  <p>
  <strong>Conflict-related deaths in 1993 stretched across Africa, the Balkans, South Asia, and Latin America with the deadliest conflict of the year in Bosnia-Herzegovina (~13,800 deaths).</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    In <strong>Bosnia-Herzegovina</strong>, the war saw sieges (e.g., <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Sarajevo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sarajevo</a></strong>) and mass atrocities such as ethnic cleansing in eastern Bosnia, drawing international condemnation but limited intervention.
  </p>
  <p>
    After a short-lived peace in <strong>Angola</strong>, the fighting in 1993 was among the deadliest of the war. Regional instability in <strong>Congo</strong> began destabilizing the region, leading toward the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Congo_War" target="_blank" rel="noopener">First Congo War</a></strong> and spiled over to <strong>Burundi</strong>, where the first democratically elected <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melchior_Ndadaye#:~:text=Melchior%20Ndadaye%20(28%20March%201953,winning%20the%20landmark%201993%20election." target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hutu president</a></strong> was assasinated, and <strong>Rwanda</strong>, where rising ethnic violence foreshadowed the 1994 genocide.
  </p>
  </div>
  <div data-year="1994">
  <p>
  <strong>The devastating toll of Rwanda in 1994 has hardly any comparison and remains one of the deadliest events of the 20th century. Elsewhere, entrenched wars in Bosnia, Afghanistan, Liberia, Angola, Turkey, and Algeria kept death tolls high, while new conflicts (like Yemen) added to global instability.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
  Between April and July 1994, extremist Hutu militias and government forces murdered <strong>800,000</strong> Tutsis and moderate Hutus in one of history’s fastest <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwandan_genocide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">genocides</a></strong>, lasting 100 days. The genocide ended only when the Tutsi-led <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwandan_Patriotic_Front" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF)</a></strong> captured <strong>Kigali</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
  Rwanda’s population was majority <strong>Hutu</strong>, with a <strong>Tutsi</strong> minority historically holding political and economic power under colonial rule (first <i><strong>Germany</strong></i>, then <i><strong>Belgium</strong></i>). Colonial administrations exacerbated ethnic divisions through identity cards and favoritism. After <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwandan_Revolution" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rwanda’s independence</a></strong> in <strong>1962</strong>, power shifted to Hutu-led governments. Anti-Tutsi discrimination and periodic massacres drove many Tutsis into exile, particularly in <strong>Uganda</strong>. In <strong>1990</strong>, <strong>the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF)</strong> — a rebel group made up of Tutsi exiles — invaded Rwanda from Uganda, sparking a civil war with the Hutu-dominated government led by President <strong>Juvénal Habyarimana</strong>.
  </p>
  </div>
  <div data-year="1995">
  <p>
  <strong>1995 was marked by atrocities in Bosnia (~17,300 deaths) and ongoing bloody civil wars in Africa and Asia. The Srebrenica massacre became symbolic of the international community’s failure to prevent genocide after Rwanda, pushing NATO to intervene more forcefully.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
  The Bosnian War reached a horrific peak in <strong>July 1995</strong>, when Bosnian Serb forces massacred over <strong>8,000</strong> Bosniak men and boys at <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srebrenica_massacre" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Srebrenica</a></strong>, a UN “safe area.” The massacre, alongside the siege of <strong>Sarajevo</strong> and other atrocities, finally triggered stronger <strong>NATO</strong> intervention, leading to airstrikes against Bosnian Serb forces. The war wound down later in the year with the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dayton_Agreement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dayton Accords</a></strong> (December 1995).
  </p>
  <p>
  Meanwhile, new dynamics emerged, such as the rise of the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Taliban</a></strong> in <strong>Afghanistan</strong> and <strong>Russia’s</strong> war in <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Chechen_War" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chechnya</a></strong>, which would shape future conflicts.
  </p>
  </div>
  <div data-year="1996">
  <p>
  <strong>1996 was the year Africa emerged as the epicenter of mass conflict deaths, with the First Congo War (~34,300 deaths) and Burundi’s civil war (~18,200 deaths) driving the toll.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
  Sparked by the aftermath of the <strong>Rwandan Genocide (1994)</strong>. Hutu militias fled into eastern <strong>Zaire</strong>, destabilizing the region. The Rwandan-backed rebels launched an uprising against President <strong>Mobutu Sese Seko</strong>, which marked the beginning of what became known as <strong><a href="https://historyguild.org/africas-world-war-the-congo-war/?srsltid=AfmBOoqetX-dNH1IVWNwL71y301MuznyKqOf748LpRLgnsZ3O0s1bKHL" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Africa’s World War”</a></strong>, involving multiple states.
  </p>
  <p>
  Globally, the rise of the <strong>Taliban in Afghanistan</strong>, establishing the <strong>Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan</strong> and the temporary <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chechen%E2%80%93Russian_conflict" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chechen victory in Russia</a></strong>, are both events shaping conflicts into the 2000s. Meanwhile, the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdish%E2%80%93Turkish_conflict" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kurdish conflict</a></strong> in Turkey remained one of the deadliest in the region, spanning over 100 years until today. 
  </p>
  </div>
  <div data-year="1997">
  <p>
  <strong>1997 was defined by the fall of Mobutu in Zaire and the spread of wars across Central Africa with deadliest toll in DR Congo (Zaire, ~13,900 deaths), alongside entrenched conflicts in Afghanistan, Algeria, Sudan, and Sri Lanka.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
  By May 1997, <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobutu_Sese_Seko" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mobutu</a></strong> was overthrown, and the country was renamed <strong>the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)</strong>. This marked the end of <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Congo_War" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the First Congo War</a></strong>, but instability laid the groundwork for <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Congo_War" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Second Congo War (1998–2003)</a></strong>. 
  </p>
  </div>
  <div data-year="1998">
  <p>
  <strong>1998 marked the eruption of the Second Congo War, Africa’s most devastating modern conflict, while Afghanistan and Sierra Leone suffered massacres on a massive scale. The year also saw the first sparks of the Kosovo War in the Balkans and the start of the Eritrea-Ethiopia border war, both of which would dominate 1999.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
  In <strong>Afghanistan</strong>, the <strong>Taliban</strong> controlled most of the country but faced fierce resistance from <strong>the Northern Alliance</strong>. In August 1998, Taliban forces massacred thousands of civilians in <strong>Mazar-i-Sharif</strong>, particularly targeting the <strong><a href="https://minorityrights.org/communities/hazaras/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hazara minority</a></strong>. 
  </p>
  <p>
  On the other side of the world ongoing narco-violence ruled <strong>Colombia</strong>.
  </p> 
  <p>
  In 1998, <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eritrean%E2%80%93Ethiopian_War" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the war between Eritrea and Ethiopia (Badme war)</a></strong> broke out over a border dispute, leading to full-scale battles. 
  </p>
  </div>
  <div data-year="1999">
  <p>
  <strong>1999 was one of the bloodiest post–Cold War years, defined by conventional wars (Ethiopia–Eritrea, Kosovo, Chechnya), brutal civil wars (Congo, Sierra Leone, Angola, Sudan), and humanitarian crises (East Timor, Sierra Leone).</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
  Ethiopia fought with Eritrea over the disputed town of <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eritrean%E2%80%93Ethiopian_War" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Badme</a></strong>. Major offensives in 1999 caused tens of thousands of deaths (<strong>in Ethiopia ~30,800, in Eritrea ~17,200 deaths</strong>), making it one of Africa’s deadliest interstate wars of the decade.
  </p>
  <p>
  Meanwhile, <strong>Second Congo War</strong>, had sucked in nine African countries and countless rebel factions. A <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Chechen_War" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second war</a></strong> was initiated also in <strong>Chechnya</strong> in August 1999 with russian forces invading the region.  
  </p>
  <p>
  1999 was marked by attrocities commited in <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Chechen_War" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sierra Leone</a></strong>, including massacring civilians, committing amputations, and using mass child soldier recruitment and in <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Chechen_War" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kosovo</a></strong> against Albanians.  
  </p>
  </div>
  <div data-year="2000">  
  <p>
  <strong>The Ethiopia–Eritrea War dominated the global conflict death toll, with nearly 50,000 killed in one year. Asia was marked by the Afghan war, Kashmir conflict, Sri Lanka, and Nepal’s rising insurgency and Russia’s war in Chechnya and Colombia’s drug-fueled insurgency stood out outside Africa/Asia.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
  Alongside the wars in <strong>Ethiopia and Afghanistan</strong>, <strong>Colombia’s</strong> conflict was fueled by the cocaine trade. The U.S. responded with <strong><a href="https://hir.harvard.edu/americas-failed-war-on-drugs-in-colombia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plan Colombia</a></strong> (1999–2015), a major aid program whose impact on drug trafficking and violence remains highly debated.  
  </p>
  <p>
  In <strong>India</strong>, violent clashes between separatists, Pakistani militants, and Indian forces continued after the 1999 <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kargil_War" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kargil War</a></strong>.
